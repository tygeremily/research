# research

This project was completed for my capstone class in Social Data Analytics.  The purpose of this research paper was to propose a study regarding social data that expands upon previous research.  

This project demonstrates my ability to conceptualize reasearch from literature review to designing the model for analysis.  No code was completed with this project but I am anticipating to begin collecting data from Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to complete the research and analysis.
